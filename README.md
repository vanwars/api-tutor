The API Tutor

A current working version is hosted at [http://apitutor.org](http://apitutor.org/), which supports connections and interactions with select endpoints associated with the Instagram, Twitter, and Soundcloud APIs. Ideally, each new API tutor page can be configured with a simple configuration file, such as the one here:
